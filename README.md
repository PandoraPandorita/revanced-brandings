# YT ReVanced Custom Icon Brandings!
Branding for ReVanced "custom-branding" patch for YouTube. Feel free to PR any new icons, use the format asked for the patch options [found here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/).

The name of the author should be in the top folder they come from. Links for their site/github profile (if any) linked alongside it would be better.
